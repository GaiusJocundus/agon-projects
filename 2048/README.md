# 2048.bin
This is the classic game 2048, which I have ported from the CP/M VT100 version to run natively on Agon. It runs in terminal mode and can be executed as a moslet (ie. from the /mos directory).

The 2048.bin game file is available pre-compiled in the Release directory.

# Source code
It's compiled using ZDS-II (the free eZ80 development tool) and I'm looking at converting it to be more user-friendly. In the meantime, there's enough there to compile as-is with ZDS-II, along with using a hex2bin to convert the output into the required bin file.

# Roadmap
Controls are simple - use WASD (or Wordstar control keys) to move the squares. Q is to quit.
